This Version of Els_kom uses a tool that does it's Testing of mods on it 
instead of having it do the testing of mods within this program internally 
which would cause bugs in this program.
Now I hope the bugs are now fixed.
Tool: Test_Mods.exe
Company Name of the tool: Eloquence
Copyright of the tool: Copyright © 2015

This Version also uses a tool used to execute the Launcher. I did try 
revising the Test mods tool to do so with a ini file but to no success.
so I made this tool as well.
Tool: Launcher.exe
Company Name of the tool: Eloquence
